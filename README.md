# Tautochrone
Python code to animate the motion of objects along a tautochrone. 

Tautochrone curves are curves where the time taken by an object traveling down the curve, subject to a uniform force, is independent of the objectâ€™s starting point on the curve. The time the object will take to reach the bottom of the curve is the same regardless of where it is placed and let go to fall freely. The word tauto-chrone literally translates to same-time. The figure below demonstrates this movement down a tautochrone curve under the force of gravity, where each of the four colored points reach the bottom of the curve at the same time even though they start at different height along the curve.
